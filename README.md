SmartFolderExplorer
===================

This is an explorer to view folders as ratios, with easy-to-read charts about size, extensions, etc.
It will help you manage to file, particularly narrow where exaclty the space is mostly occupied.
It also displays statistics and charts in a very user-frendly and graphical way.
